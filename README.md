# OOP244-Project Milestone-5/1

:space_invader:	Here is the long description of the project...

:dizzy:	The project is a retail and inventory management system developed in C++ programming language. The system is designed to manage inventory, track sales, and handle transactions in a retail setting. The system includes several modules to manage items, dates, and various utility functions.

:dizzy:	The items in the inventory are classified as non-perishable or perishable, with non-perishable items being items that do not have a limited shelf life, such as office supplies and snacks, while perishable items are items that have a limited shelf life and will spoil after a certain amount of time, such as fresh produce or dairy products.

:dizzy:	The system includes a point-of-sale (POS) application that allows for the scanning of items and the calculation of the total cost of a customer's purchase. The POS app is also connected to a POS input/output (POSIO) module, which allows for the input and output of data from the POS system.

:dizzy:	The system also includes various utility modules, such as the "utils" module, which contains various utility functions and tools to assist in the management of the inventory and sales data. The system keeps track of the date each item was added to inventory and the quantity available at that time, as well as whether each item was sold or not, along with the date of sale.
The project is designed to help businesses manage their inventory levels and monitor sales trends, enabling them to make informed decisions about ordering new stock, pricing items, and managing their inventory more efficiently. The project is useful for any retail business that wants to streamline its inventory management processes and improve its sales performance.
