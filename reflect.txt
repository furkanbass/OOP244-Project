I found the whole project to be challenging but rewarding, as it required me to use many of the concepts we have covered in class, inheritance, and file I/O. In particular, I've used the provided source "https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/" to be very helpful, as it provided me with a clear and detailed explanation oop concept and dynamic memory, which was crucial for the successful implementation of the project. Overall, I am very satisfied with my work on this project, and I believe that it has helped me to solidify my understanding of C++ programming concepts. Thank you for your guidance and support throughout this course.
